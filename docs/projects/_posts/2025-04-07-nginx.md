The purpose of this project will be to make a web server. But of course, we need something to serve... on the web. So, for this project we are going to be using [NGINX](https://nginx.org/) [![GitHub Org's stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/nginx?label=NGINX)](https://github.com/nginx) to self host [Etherpad](https://etherpad.org/) [![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ether/etherpad-lite?label=Etherpad)](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite).

# Prerequisites

{% include projects/prereq-pi.html %}

# Install & Configure: Etherpad

## Package installation

{% include projects/debian-start.html %}

### Install [Node.js](https://deb.nodesource.com/)

```
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo bash -
```
```
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

## Run as a different user

```
sudo adduser --system --group --shell /bin/bash --home /opt/etherpad etherpad
```


## Configure [Etherpad Lite](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite)

1. Clone the GitHub branch:
    ```
    cd /opt/etherpad
    ```
    ```
    sudo git clone --branch master https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite.git .
    ```

    Note: The dot (.) at the end of the `git clone` command is important - it will clone the files into the current directory, rather than into a subdirectory.
    {:.warning}

1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    sudo ./bin/installDeps.sh
    ```
1. Change the ownership of the cloned & installed files to the user you created:
    ```
    sudo chown -vR etherpad:etherpad /opt/etherpad/
    ```
1. Create a log directory and change it's ownership:
    ```
    sudo mkdir /var/log/etherpad
    ```
    ```
    sudo chown -vR etherpad:etherpad /var/log/etherpad/
    ```
1. Edit `settings.json`:

    e.g.
    ```
    sudo vi settings.json
    ```
    - Update the line `"trustProxy": false,` to be `"trustProxy": true,`. This is necessary for later when we configure NGINX.
    - Take note of this section (even though we are not changing it). As the content indicates, by default Etherpad is going to run with a "dirty" database. This is only meant for testing purposes, and since we *are* testing, we are not going to change it, however you would usually want to configure a proper database at this point. But for now, moving on!
        ```
        "dbType": "dirty",
        "dbSettings": {
            "filename": "var/dirty.db"
        },
        ```

## Create a systemd service

1. Edit a new file `/etc/systemd/system/etherpad.service`.

    e.g.
    ```
    sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/etherpad.service
    ```

1. Add the following content:
    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Etherpad-lite, the collaborative editor.
    After=syslog.target network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=etherpad
    Group=etherpad
    WorkingDirectory=/opt/etherpad
    Environment=NODE_ENV=production
    ExecStart=pnpm run prod
    Restart=always

    StandardOutput=append:/var/log/etherpad/etherpad.log
    StandardError=append:/var/log/etherpad/etherpad-error.log

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```
1. Reload to get the new configuration.
    ```
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```
1. Enable the new service, so that it runs when the Pi starts.
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable etherpad
    ```
1. Start the service
    ```
    sudo systemctl start etherpad
    ```
1. Check its status (make sure it is `active (running)`)
    ```
    sudo systemctl status etherpad
    ```
1. Navigate to [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) in a web browser. You should now see Etherpad. (alternatively, from a different host on the same network, `http://<ip-address>:9001`)

# Install & Configure: NGINX

## Package installation

```
sudo apt install nginx
```

## Configure NGINX

### Basics

Let's talk about NGINX configuration generically for a moment.

1. *Server* blocks
    ```
    server {
        ...
    }
    ```
    - A configuration file may contain 1 or more *server* blocks
    - Each *server* block is differentiated by which *ports* they listen on, and the configured *server names*.
    - NGINX decides which server with which to process the request, then tests the URI specified in the request's header against the parameters of the *location* block inside the given *server* block. (see also: [How nginx processes a request](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/request_processing.html))
1. *Location* blocks
    ```
    location <prefix> {
        ...
    }
    ```
    - A *server* block may contain 1 or more *location* blocks
    - The `<prefix>` is compared with the URI from the request
    - If there are several matching location blocks nginx selects from longest to shortest
        - The shortest prefix of length 1, `/`, will be selected if all other location blocks do not match.
    - Examples of what can go inside a location block:
        - root directive: the URI will be added to the root directive to form the path to the requested file on the local file system

            e.g. `http://localhost/some/example.html` -> `/data/www/some/example.html`
            ```
            location / {
                root /data/www;
            }
            ```
        - proxy server: pass on requests to the proxied servers & send received responses back to client

            e.g.
            ```
            location / {
                proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
            }
            ```

### Our configuration

1. Edit a new NGINX configuration file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/etherpad.conf`

    e.g.
    ```
    sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/etherpad.conf
    ```

1. Add the following content, replacing `<DOMAIN>` with your domain. Let's use our `<hostname>.local` for the purposes of this project (e.g. `druid.local`). This will allow us to proceed without needing to do other configuration. (see also: [Etherpad NGINX examples](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/wiki/How-to-put-Etherpad-Lite-behind-a-reverse-Proxy#nginx)):
    ```
    server {
        listen       80;
        listen       [::]:80;
        server_name  <DOMAIN>;

        access_log  /var/log/nginx/etherpad.access.log;
        error_log   /var/log/nginx/etherpad.error.log;

        location / {
            proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:9001;
            proxy_buffering    off;
            proxy_set_header   Host $host;
            proxy_pass_header  Server;

            # proxy headers
            proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
            proxy_http_version  1.1;

            # websocket proxying
            proxy_set_header  Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header  Connection "upgrade";
        }
    }
    ```

    Note: Port 80 instead of port 443. We aren't doing HTTPS just yet.
    {:.info}
1. Enable the configuration by creating a link:
    ```
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/etherpad.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    ```
1. Check the configuration file syntax, and reload the NGINX service.
    ```
    sudo nginx -t
    ```
    ```
    sudo systemctl reload nginx
    ```
1. Navigate to the domain that you configured in your web browser (e.g. `druid.local`). You should now again see Etherpad.

    <img style="width:80%;height:auto;border:0px solid #505fb5" alt="Etherpad http://<hostname>.local" src="/assets/images/projects/nginx_etherpad/etherpad-nginx-hostname.png">

    Note: If it does not load in the web browser, did you set the domain to `<hostname>.local`?
    {:.warning}

1. We can also test the collaboration aspect, by opening up the site on two devices, and editing a 'pad' of the same name. We can edit in both places, and see each others edits.

    </video>

# Self Signed Certificate

We can now see Etherpad at our `<hostname>.local`, but our browser doesn't like it - its not secure. Let's fix that (somewhat) by creating a quick self signed cert. For actual projects, you may want to configure a SSL cert with something like certbot.

## Generate the cert

1. Generate a self signed cert:
    ```
    sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
        -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key \
        -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
    ```
1. You will need to give it some values (replace with your values):

    e.g.
    ```
    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
    into your certificate request.
    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
    For some fields there will be a default value,
    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
    -----
    Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
    State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Maryland
    Locality Name (eg, city) []:College Park
    Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Homelab Club at UMD
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
    Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:druid.local
    Email Address []:admin@druid.local
    ```
1. Create a strong [Diffie-Hellman (DH) group](https://www.watchguard.com/help/docs/help-center/en-us/Content/en-US/Fireware/bovpn/manual/diffie_hellman_c.html)
    ```
    sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048
    ```

## Configure NGINX

1. Point NGINX at our cert files - edit `/etc/nginx/snippets/self-signed.conf`:

    e.g.
    ```
    sudo vi /etc/nginx/snippets/self-signed.conf
    ```
    - Add the content:
        ```
        ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
        ```
1. Edit SSL settings, `/etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf`

    e.g.
    ```
    sudo vi /etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf
    ```
    - Add content:
        ```
        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        ssl_ciphers "EECDH+AESGCM:EDH+AESGCM:AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH";
        ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
        ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
        ssl_session_tickets off;
        ssl_stapling on;
        ssl_stapling_verify on;
        resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 valid=300s;
        resolver_timeout 5s;
        # Disable preloading HSTS for now.  You can use the commented out header line that includes
        # the "preload" directive if you understand the implications.
        #add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains; preload";
        add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubdomains";
        add_header X-Frame-Options DENY;
        add_header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff;

        ssl_dhparam /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem;
        ```

## Edit our NGINX configuration for Etherpad

1. Edit the NGINX configuration file that we made previously (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/etherpad.conf`)

    e.g.
    ```
    sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/etherpad.conf
    ```

1. Redirect HTTP (port 80) requests to HTTPS. Indicate a temporary move (302 error/redirect). We can use 301 later after we make sure everything works.
    - Add the line `return 302 https://$server_name$request_uri;` after the `server_name` line, followed by a closing `}`. (replacing `<DOMAIN>` with your domain (e.g. `druid.local`))

        e.g.
        ```
        server {
            listen       80;
            listen       [::]:80;
            server_name  <DOMAIN>;
            return 302 https://$server_name$request_uri;
        }

        ...
        ```
1. Start listening for HTTPS (port 443) (replacing `<DOMAIN>` with your domain (e.g. `druid.local`))
    ```
    server {
        listen       443 ssl http2;
        listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
        server_name  <DOMAIN>;

        include snippets/self-signed.conf;
        include snippets/ssl-params.conf;

    ...
    ```
1. Add a fix for an [Etherpad related error that I ran into](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/5829). I do think that has to do with the "test" environment that we are creating.
    ```
    ...
    location / {
        ...

	    add_header X-Frame-Options ALLOW always;

        ...
    }
    ...
    ```

    - Your file should now look something like (replacing `<DOMAIN>` with your domain (e.g. `druid.local`)):

        ```
        server {
            listen       80;
            listen       [::]:80;
            server_name  <DOMAIN>;
            return 302 https://$server_name$request_uri;
        }

        server {
            listen       443 ssl http2;
            listen       [::]:443 ssl http2;
            server_name  <DOMAIN>;

            include snippets/self-signed.conf;
            include snippets/ssl-params.conf;

            access_log  /var/log/nginx/etherpad.access.log;
            error_log   /var/log/nginx/etherpad.error.log;

            location / {
                proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:9001;
                proxy_buffering    off;
                proxy_set_header   Host $host;
                proxy_pass_header  Server;

                # proxy headers
                proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
                proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
                proxy_http_version  1.1;

                # websocket proxying
                proxy_set_header  Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header  Connection "upgrade";

                add_header X-Frame-Options ALLOW always;
            }
        }
        ```

1. Check the NGINX configuration
    ```
    sudo nginx -t
    ```
    The warning that looks like this is expected:
    ```
    labclub@druid:~ $ sudo nginx -t
    2025/04/07 00:53:45 [warn] 2000#2000: "ssl_stapling" ignored, issuer certificate not found for certificate "/etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt"
    nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
    nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
    labclub@druid:~ $ 
    ```
1. Restart NGINX
    ```
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```
1. Navigate to the domain that you configured in your web browser (e.g. `druid.local`). Regardless of if you go to `http://`, `https://`, or don't specify, it should redirect you to `https://`. If promted, accept the risk & continue - we know its self signed. You should now again see Etherpad, but this time, with a cert! We can look at this cert's info to see it is what we generated.

# Recommended Next Steps

1. Configure a firewall (e.g. [UFW](/projects/ufw))
1. Configure a non-self signed cert (e.g. certbot)
