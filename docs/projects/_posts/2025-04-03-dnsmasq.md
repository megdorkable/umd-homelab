In this project, we are going to be using `dnsmasq`. There are other options for both a DNS server (such as our [BIND9](/projects/dns) project) and a DHCP server.

# Prerequisites

1. This project assumes that you have already followed our [Raspberry Pi installation](/projects/raspberrypios) project, and have the resulting configured Raspberry Pi. If you are installing on different hardware or a different OS, these steps may not all be the same for you.

**Note:** Because I do not need a GUI for this and would like to conserve resources, I installed the 'Lite' version of Raspberry Pi OS for this project.

## Quick Review: DNS

**(D)omain (N)ame (S)ystem**

Make DNS queries to lookup DNS records.

Very short explanation of some types of DNS records:

- A: "address", hostname -> IP address
- AAAA: "address x4" hostname -> IPv6 address
- PTR: "pointer", IP address -> hostname
- CNAME: "canonical name", hostname -> hostname
- MX: "mail exchange"
- TXT: "text"
- NS: "nameserver"

**Note:** This is just a quick review! Check out our [DNS knowledge article](/knowledge/dns) for more info.

**Note:** IPv4 32 bits, IPv6 128 bits, 32 x 4 = 128)

# Install & Configure

## Package installation

{% include projects/debian-start.html %}

### Install DNSMasq

```
sudo apt install dnsmasq
```

### Install Other

```
sudo apt install bind9-dnsutils
```

**Note:** `bind9-dnsutils` gives us (among other things) the commands `nslookup` & `dig`. It has a package dependency for `bind9-host` which gives us the commend `host`. More info about these commands is in the [Troubleshooting](#commands-to-help-us-test) section below.
{:.info}

**Note:** `dnsutils` is a transitional package for `bind9-dnsutils`. So we will not use it here, but you may see `dnsutils` used in other guides.

## Basic Pi Configuration

### Set hostname
{% include projects/debian-hostname.html %}

### Set a static IP
{% include projects/debian-staticip.html %}

## Configure DNS Server

### DNSMasq Configuration

Edit `/etc/dnsmasq.conf`

e.g.
```
sudo vi /etc/dnsmasq.conf
```

- Find, uncomment (remove the `#` at the start of the line), and change the following lines based on the values for your setup:
    1. Restrict what queries the server forwards to upstream servers:
        - `domain-needed`
        - `bogus-priv`
    1. Prevent dnsmasq from reading `/etc/resolv.conf` to get its servers:
        - `no-resolv`
    1. Specify a port, interface, & interface addresses: 
        - `port=53`
        - `listen-address=127.0.0.1,192.168.0.2`
        - `interface=eth0`
    1. Add other name servers (or add your own preferred servers, this is is using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-1.1.1.1/)'s.):
        ```
        server=1.1.1.1
        server=1.0.0.1
        ```
    1. Configure a domain, such that all entries defined in `/etc/hosts` will get a domain suffix (e.g. `bard` becomes `bard.local`):
        - `expand-hosts`
        - `domain=local`
    1. Enable DNS Cache and set a cache-size:
        - `cache-size=1000`

Example uncommented lines after all the above changes:

```
labclub@bard:~ $ cat /etc/dnsmasq.conf | grep -vE "^#" | grep -vE "^$"
port=53
domain-needed
bogus-priv
no-resolv
server=1.1.1.1
server=1.0.0.1
interface=eth0
listen-address=127.0.0.1,192.168.0.2
expand-hosts
domain=local
cache-size=1000
```

### Hosts configuration

Edit `/etc/hosts`

e.g.
```
sudo vi /etc/hosts
```

1. Add hosts

    e.g.
    ```
    192.168.0.100	barbarian
    192.168.0.101	cleric
    192.168.0.102	druid
    192.168.0.103	fighter
    192.168.0.104	paladin
    192.168.0.105	rogue
    192.168.0.106	sorcerer
    192.168.0.107	warlock
    ```

### Apply Changes

Restart the service to apply changes

```
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```

And then check the status of the service:

```
sudo systemctl status dnsmasq
```

## Test the DNS server

```
dig <domain> @localhost
```

## Using the DNS server
{% include projects/debian-setdns.html %}

## Configure DHCP Server

### DNSMasq Configuration

Edit `/etc/dnsmasq.conf`

e.g.
```
sudo vi /etc/dnsmasq.conf
```

1. Set the DHCP range, subnet mask, lease time
    ```
    dhcp-range=<ip-range-start>,<ip-range-end>,<netmask>,<lease-time>
    ```
    
    e.g.
    ```
    dhcp-range=192.168.0.100,192.168.0.200,255.255.255.0,12h
    ```
1. Enable ethers:
    ```
    read-ethers
    ```

Note: It is worth mentioning that the default location for leases (which we have not changed here) is `/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases`, and if you need to go delete a lease, especially while you are testing things, you can go remove the relevant line in that file.
{:.info}

### /etc/ethers Configuration

Edit `/etc/ethers`

e.g.
```
sudo vi /etc/ethers
```

- Add MAC address / hostname pairings

    e.g.
    ```
    d8:3a:dd:d7:bf:73 druid
    ```

### Apply Changes

Restart the service to apply changes

```
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```

And then check the status of the service:

```
sudo systemctl status dnsmasq
```

## Configure Firewall

It is recommended to also configure a [firewall](/projects/ufw).

# Troubleshooting

## Commands to help us test

### host
DNS lookup utility ([man page](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/bind9-host/host.1.en.html)) 

 (e.g. `host google.com`)

### nslookup
query Internet name servers interactively ([man page](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/bind9-dnsutils/nslookup.1.en.html)) 

(e.g. `nslookup google.com`, `nslookup -type=ns google.com`, `nslookup google.com 1.1.1.1`)

### dig
DNS lookup utility ([man page](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/bind9-dnsutils/dig.1.en.html))

(e.g. `dig google.com`)

### ping
send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets to network hosts ([man page](https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/inetutils-ping/ping.1.en.html)) 

(e.g. `ping google.com`, `ping google.com -c 4`)

## Can you connect to port 53?

```
telnet <remote-server> 53
```

e.g.

```
bash-3.2$ telnet 1.1.1.1 53
Trying 1.1.1.1...
Connected to one.one.one.one.
Escape character is '^]'.
```

```
nc -vz -w 1 \<remote-server\> 53
nc -vuz -w 1 \<remote-server\> 53
```

e.g.

```
bash-3.2$ nc -vz -w 1 1.1.1.1 53
Connection to 1.1.1.1 port 53 [tcp/domain] succeeded!
bash-3.2$ nc -vuz -w 1 1.1.1.1 53
Connection to 1.1.1.1 port 53 [udp/domain] succeeded!
bash-3.2$
```

### If no, is DNSMasq running on port 53?

```
ss -tulpn | grep 53
```

### If no, is port 53 open?

```
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep :53
sudo lsof -Pi | grep LISTEN
sudo nmap -sS localhost
sudo nmap -sU localhost
```

Have you configured any variety of firewall? And the follow up question, have you configured it to allow DNS / port 53? (e.g. `iptables`, `nftables`, `firewalld`, `ufw`)

## Status of the dnsmasq service

```
sudo systemctl is-enabled dnsmasq
sudo systemctl status dnsmasq
sudo journalctl -u dnsmasq
```
