1. Edit `/etc/hosts`. Change the line that looks something like `127.0.1.1	raspberrypi`. Replace `raspberrypi` with your hostname.

    e.g.
    ```
    sudo vi /etc/hosts
    ```
1. Edit `/etc/hostname`. Replace the hostname in the file with your new hostname.

    e.g.
    ```
    sudo vi /etc/hostname
    ```
1. Reboot the Pi:
    ```
    sudo shutdown -r now
    ```
1. One the host has finished rebooting, check to see if your changes applied:
    ```
    hostname
    ```

**Note:** You might ask, why not use `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <your-hostname>`? If you are curious, you can run this and then `cat` the mentioned files, and see what has changed.

**Note:** After you set the hostname and before you reboot, it may yell at you about the previous hostname name/service not being known.
